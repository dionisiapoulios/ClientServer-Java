The yield method of the thread class is defined by oracle as:

"A hint to the scheduler that the current thread is willing to 
yield its current use of a processor. The scheduler is free to ignore this hint."

This means that the scheduler does not necessarily yield the process when it is told to 
and therefore could cause a difference in running time every time it is being run.
